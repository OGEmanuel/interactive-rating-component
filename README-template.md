## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

These lines of Javascript code helped me to practice what I learnt from my JavaScript course

```js
ratings.forEach(ratings => ratings.classList.remove('selected'));
clicked.classList.add('selected');
```

### Continued development

I'd like to be able to replicate such confidence with more advanced JS projects
